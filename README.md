# Iwasawa-Decomposition
We provide code to compute the Iwasawa decomposition of a given n dimensional non-singular matrix.
We use the Gram-Schmidt orthogonalization procedure to compute the row form of the Iwasawa decomposition:
Express the given matrix A as A = NDK, where N is a strictly lower-triangular matrix with determinant 1,
D is a diagonal matrix with positive determinant, and K is an orthogonal matrix.
